# Eludris

Eludris is simply put a group of people —not necessarily programmers— who come together to make fun and awesome stuff.

Since right now everything is so-so and nothing is set in stone expect a more "high effort" README sometimes soon.

## Projects:

- Eludris (iconic): A *hopefully* free (as in monetary value & freedom) and open source decentralized federated social media platform with e2ee for stuff that matters heavily inspired by Discord and Reddit with a pinch of Twitter. (WIP hence private for now)

## Wanna join in?

Check this repository's files.

Note:
> This was gonna be much harder but it was nerfed because I actually want people to join.

> Oh, you're not a programmer? just contact Enoki ig.
